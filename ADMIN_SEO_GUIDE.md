## 🔄 Auto-Generation vs Manual Input

### How It Works:

**If you FILL the fields**:

- ✅ Full control over SEO
- ✅ Best for important pages

**If you LEAVE BLANK**:
- ✅ System auto-generates from content
- ✅ Uses vendor/portfolio/blog data
- ✅ Still SEO-friendly
- ✅ Saves time for bulk entries

### Auto-Generation Examples:

**Vendor Profile** (if meta_title is blank):
```
Generated: "Raj Photography - Wedding Photographer in Kolkata | chobighar"
From: name + subcategory_name + location + brand
```

**Portfolio** (if meta_description is blank):
```
Generated: "Priya & Rahul Wedding. Location: ITC Royal Bengal, Kolkata. 
Professional Wedding Photography by chobighar."
From: title + subtitle + location + category
```

**Blog Post** (if meta_keywords is blank):
```
Generated: "10 Wedding Photography Tips, photography, wedding, tips, guide, 
chobighar, professional photographer"
From: title + tags + category
```
