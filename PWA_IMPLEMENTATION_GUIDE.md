## 🚀 How It Works

### Installation Flow:
1. User visits the website
2. Browser checks if PWA can be installed
3. Smart banner appears at the top (if not already installed/dismissed)
4. User clicks "Install" → Browser shows native install prompt
5. User confirms → App installs to device
6. Banner disappears and won't show again

### Detection Logic:
```typescript
// Check if already installed
if (window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)').matches) {
  // Already installed - don't show banner
}

// Check if previously dismissed
const dismissed = localStorage.getItem('pwa-banner-dismissed');
if (dismissed === 'true') {
  // User dismissed it - don't show
}

// Listen for install prompt
window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', (e) => {
  // Show our custom banner
});
```
