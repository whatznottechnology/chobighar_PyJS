## üîß Technical Setup (Already Configured)

### Backend Configuration ‚úÖ
```python
# Models (blog/models.py)
featured_image = models.ImageField(upload_to='blog/featured/', null=True, blank=True)
thumbnail_image = models.ImageField(upload_to='blog/thumbnails/', null=True, blank=True)
og_image = models.ImageField(upload_to='blog/og/', null=True, blank=True)

# Settings
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'media'
```

### API Response ‚úÖ
The serializers return full image URLs:
```json
{
  "thumbnail": "https://admin.chobighar.com/media/blog/thumbnails/image.jpg",
  "featured_image": "https://admin.chobighar.com/media/blog/featured/image.jpg"
}
```

### Frontend Image Handling ‚úÖ
```typescript
// Frontend automatically handles:
getMediaUrl(post.thumbnail)
// Returns: https://admin.chobighar.com/media/blog/thumbnails/image.jpg

// OR if no thumbnail, uses featured image
// OR shows elegant placeholder icon if no image at all
```

## üì± Frontend Display

### **Blog Listing Page** (`/blog`)
- Shows `thumbnail_image` OR `featured_image`
- If no image: Shows gradient placeholder with üì∏ (featured) or üìù (regular) icon
- Images are responsive and optimized with Next.js Image component

### **Blog Detail Page** (`/blog/[slug]`)
- Shows `featured_image` as large hero image
- Properly sized and optimized
- Falls back gracefully if no image uploaded

### **Related Posts Section**
- Shows thumbnails of related articles
- Same image handling as blog listing

---

## üéØ Image Upload Steps

1. **Create/Edit Blog Post** in Django Admin
2. **Click "Choose File"** for Featured Image field
3. **Select your image** from computer
4. **(Optional)** Upload custom Thumbnail Image
5. **(Optional)** Add Alt Text in `featured_image_alt` field (good for SEO!)
6. **Save** the blog post
7. **Publish** by setting Status to "Published"

---

## üåê How It Works in Production

### Upload Process:
```
Admin uploads image
    ‚Üì
Saved to: /home/chobigharcom/public_html/media/blog/featured/image.jpg
    ‚Üì
Accessible at: https://admin.chobighar.com/media/blog/featured/image.jpg
    ‚Üì
API returns full URL
    ‚Üì
Frontend fetches and displays with Next.js Image optimization
```

### Frontend Image Flow:
```typescript
1. API Call: GET /api/blog/posts/
2. Response includes: "thumbnail": "/media/blog/thumbnails/image.jpg"
3. getMediaUrl() converts to: "https://admin.chobighar.com/media/blog/thumbnails/image.jpg"
4. Next.js Image component loads and optimizes the image
5. User sees the image on the blog page
```

## üé® Image Best Practices

### Recommended Sizes:
- **Featured Image**: 1200x630px (16:9 or 1.91:1 ratio)
- **Thumbnail**: 600x400px (3:2 ratio)
- **OG Image**: 1200x630px (1.91:1 ratio)

### File Formats:
- **Best**: WebP (smaller file size, great quality)
- **Good**: JPG (for photos), PNG (for graphics)
- **Max Size**: Keep under 500KB for fast loading

### Optimization:
- Compress images before upload (use TinyPNG, ImageOptim, etc.)
- Use descriptive filenames: `wedding-photography-tips.jpg`
- Always add alt text for accessibility and SEO

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Image not showing on frontend"

**Check 1:** Is the blog post Published?
- Status must be "Published" (not "Draft")

**Check 2:** Did the image upload successfully?
- Go to Django Admin ‚Üí View the blog post
- You should see thumbnail preview under the file field

**Check 3:** Is MEDIA_URL accessible?
- Try: `https://admin.chobighar.com/media/blog/featured/yourimage.jpg`
- Should load the image directly

**Check 4:** Check browser console
- Look for 404 errors on image URLs
- Verify the URL format is correct

**Check 5:** Verify environment variable
- NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL should be set to admin.chobighar.com
- Check in `.env.local` or deployment settings
