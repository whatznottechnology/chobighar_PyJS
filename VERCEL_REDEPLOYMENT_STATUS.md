## ⚙️ Environment Variables Check

### Required Variables on Vercel:

**Go to:** Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables

**Verify these exist:**

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL = https://admin.chobighar.com
# or your backend URL

NEXT_PUBLIC_FRONTEND_URL = https://chobighar.vercel.app
# or your custom domain
```

### If Missing or Need Update:

1. Add/Edit the variable
2. Select "Production" environment
3. Click "Save"
4. **Important:** Click "Redeploy" button to apply changes

---

## 🔧 Backend CORS Update (CRITICAL!)

### Make sure your Django backend allows the Vercel domain:

**File:** `backend/chobighar_backend/settings.py`

```python
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
    'http://localhost:3000',  # Development
    'https://chobighar.vercel.app',  # Production - UPDATE THIS!
    # Or your custom domain:
    # 'https://chobighar.com',
    # 'https://www.chobighar.com',
]

# For all Vercel preview URLs:
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEXES = [
    r"^https://.*\.vercel\.app$",
]

CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = [
    'http://localhost:3000',
    'https://chobighar.vercel.app',  # UPDATE THIS!
]
```

**Then restart your Django server!**
